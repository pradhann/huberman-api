        "summary": "This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors  either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Paul Conti\n(00:03:46) Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n(00:06:55) What is a Healthy Self?\n(00:10:41) Agency & Gratitude; Empowerment & Humility \n(00:16:13) Physical Health & Mental Health Parallels\n(00:20:21) Structure of Self; Unconscious vs. Conscious Mind; Iceberg\n(00:26:15) Defense Mechanisms; Character Structure Nest, Sense of Self \n(00:31:27) Predispositions & Character Structure\n(00:36:01) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:37:27) Character Structure & Action States; Physical Health Parallels\n(00:46:20) Anxiety; Understanding Excessive Anxiety\n(00:53:12) Improving Confidence: State Dependence & Phenomenology; Narcissism\n(00:59:44) Changing Beliefs & Internal Narratives\n(01:06:04) Individuality & Addressing Mental Health Challenges\n(01:11:21) Mental Health Goals & Growth\n(01:17:32) Function of Self\n(01:23:00) Defense Mechanisms: Projection, Displacement\n(01:30:14) Projection, Displacement, Projective Identification\n(01:34:50) Humor, Sarcasm, Cynicism\n(01:40:41) Attention & Salience; Negative Internal Dialogue \n(01:45:02) Repetition Compulsion & Defense Mechanism, Trauma\n(01:58:55) Mirror Meditation & Self Awareness; Structure & Function of Self, Cupboards\n(02:04:57) Pillars of the Mind, Agency & Gratitude, Happiness\n(02:13:53) Generative Drive, Aggressive & Pleasure Drives\n(02:21:33) Peace, Contentment & Delight, Generative Drive; Amplification\n(02:24:18) Generative Drive, Amplification & Overcoming\n(02:33:00) Over-Thinking, Procrastination, Choices\n(02:42:20) Aggressive, Pleasure & Generative Drives, Envy\n(02:49:46) Envy, Destruction, Mass Shootings\n(02:55:38) Demoralization, Isolation, Low Aggressive Drive\n(03:02:50) Demoralization, Affiliate Defense \n(03:09:32) Strong Aggressive Drive, Competition, Generative Drive Reframing \n(03:20:02) Cultivating a Generative Drive, Spirited Inquiry of the Cupboards\n(03:26:06) Current Mental Health Care & Medications\n(03:35:33) Role of Medicine in Exploration\n(03:40:41) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Lindens terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life.

        "summary": "In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brains glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term K-holes).

We discuss the brains several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders.

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as ecstasy or molly, including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces threat detection and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA crash, the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTSD, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) MDMA Ecstasy\n(00:04:37) Sponsors: Helix Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n(00:08:18) MDMA History & Synthesis; Legality\n(00:14:45) MDMA, Methamphetamine (Meth), Dopamine & Serotonin\n(00:23:30) MDMA vs Psychedelics vs Ketamine\n(00:26:54) MDMA & Serotonin 1B Receptor, Subjective Feelings, Trauma\n(00:33:36) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:51) Amygdala & Threat Detection, Pro-Social Behavior, MDMA Dosages\n(00:45:48) Interoception, MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n(00:52:36) Long-Term Effects, Threat Detection & PTSD\n(00:56:14) MDMA, Social Connection & Empathy; Meth, SSRIs\n(01:06:10) Sponsor: LMNT\n(01:07:22) Oxytocin & MDMA\n(01:16:10) Safety & Neurotoxicity; Recreational Use, Caffeine & Fentanyl\n(01:26:36) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?; Poly-Pharmacology, Body Temperature\n(01:37:07) Post-MDMA Crash, Prolactin & P5P\n(01:43:07) PTSD & Trauma; Talk Therapy, SSRIs\n(01:54:09) PTSD Treatment: Talk Therapy + MDMA\n(02:02:46) MDMA & Addiction; Dissociative PTSD & Empathy\n(02:09:47) Side-Effects?, MDMA Efficacy & Legality\n(02:15:22) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to go internal, and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks.

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss what psilocybin is (chemically) and how it works at the cellular and neural circuit level to trigger neuroplasticity, which is our brains ability to rewire itself in ways that lead to long-lasting shifts in our emotional, cognitive and behavioral patterns and abilities. I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n(00:08:32) Sponsors: Eight Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n(00:12:00) Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin\n(00:17:00) The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n(00:21:40) Serotonin Receptor Expression; Visual Hallucinations & Eyes Closed\n(00:27:21) Safety & Cautions for Specific Patient Populations\n(00:29:13) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:28) Psilocybin, Magic Mushrooms Dosing, Micro-Dosing, Heroic Doses\n(00:36:21) Psychedelic Journey: Set, Setting & Support\n(00:43:43) Music & the Psilocybin Journey; Duration of Effects\n(00:48:58) Psilocybin & the Brain: Subjective Experiences, Perception\n(00:58:36) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:59:48) Brain Networks & Therapeutic Outcomes\n(01:05:23) Creativity; Music, Emotionality & Psychedelic Journeys\n(01:12:39) Depression & Psychedelics as Neuroplasticity Wedge\n(01:16:53) Positive Psychedelic Journeys, Unity, Oceanic Boundlessness\n(01:25:23) Bad Trips, Anxiety & Physiological Sighs\n(01:32:57) Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin\n(01:36:11) Neuroplasticity, Structural Brain Changes & Psilocybin\n(01:48:08) Psychedelics: Therapeutic Breakthroughs & Depression\n(01:56:37) Combining Psilocybin Therapy & Talk Therapy, Antidepressant Effects\n(02:03:11) Psilocybin Experience & Mental Health\n(2:06:42) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his labs research on the biological mechanisms of smell (olfaction) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of social sensing and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his labs work on digitization of smell  which may soon allow online communication to include sending of odors via the internet. Dr. Sobels work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Noam Sobel\n(00:03:46) Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n(00:06:46) Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n(00:14:49) Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n(00:21:39) Brain Processing of Smell\n(00:24:40) Smell & Memories\n(00:27:52) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:29:07) Humans & Odor Tracking\n(00:39:25) The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n(00:48:18) Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n(00:54:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction\n(01:00:12) Congenital Anosmia\n(01:05:01) Sponsor: InsideTracker\n(01:06:19) Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n(01:15:07) Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others\n(01:22:02) Odors & Romantic Attraction\n(01:24:58) Vomeronasal Organ, Bruce Effect & Miscarriage\n(01:40:20) Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n(01:50:26) Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n(02:03:57) Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n(02:12:11) Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n(02:27:46) Science Politics\n(02:37:54) Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n(02:45:34) Human Perception & Odorant Similarity\n(02:52:12) Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n(03:05:50) Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n(03:10:55) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair dead (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress.

She explains stress intervention tools using top-down techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

We discuss his labs discovery that time-restricted eating (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Satchin Panda\n(00:03:18) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:24) Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health\n(00:14:38) Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n(00:21:34) Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n(00:25:28) Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat\n(00:28:45) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:34:04) CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n(00:47:20) Gender, Hormones & CR; Relative Energy Deficient in Sports (REDS)\n(00:52:40) Physical Activity, Nutrition & Feeding Window\n(00:59:04) Nutrition Timing, Quality & Quantity; Low- Carbohydrate Diet\n(01:03:00) Caffeine, Nighttime Socialization, Fire, Breakfast\n(01:16:20) Circadian Rhythm, Night Owls & Genetics\n(01:26:37) Morning vs. Nighttime Discussions, Me Time\n(01:30:08) Light Sensitivity & Night Owls; Puberty, Melatonin\n(01:36:05) Shift Workers, Health & Disease\n(01:45:43) Artificial Lights, Young Adults & Sleep, Metabolic Dysfunction\n(01:50:59) Firefighters, Sleep & TRE; Cardiovascular Health, Blood Glucose\n(02:05:18) Shift Workers & Sleep; Alcohol & Caffeine\n(02:09:15) 12- Hour Feeding Window for Adults & Children, Sleep\n(02:22:10) Meal Timing\n(02:25:20) Complete Fast, Longer Fasts, Physical Health & Mental Health\n(02:28:12) Fat Fasting, Blood Glucose & Insulin\n(02:31:57) Fasting, Metformin, Rapamycin & Longevity; Human Applicability?\n(02:39:14) Circadian Rhythm & Metabolism\n(02:41:36) Ontime Health App, Circadian Clock App\n(02:46:17) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the heritability of acquired traits and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavis work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Oded Rechavi\n(00:02:25) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:06:04) DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells\n(00:14:36) Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits\n(00:22:54) Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology\n(00:25:16) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:30:06) James McConnell & Memory Transfer\n(00:37:31) Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics \n(00:45:13) Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes \n(00:50:43) Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring\n(00:59:06) Generational Epigenetic Inheritance \n(01:10:20) Model Organisms, C. elegans\n(01:21:50) C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs\n(01:26:02) RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity\n(01:34:13) RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects\n(01:38:41) Response Duration & Environment\n(01:47:50) Generational Memory Transmission, RNA\n(01:59:36) Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues\n(02:04:48) Transmission of Sexual Choice\n(02:11:22) Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing\n(02:17:56) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory\n(02:29:26) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance.

I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertilityseveral of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children.

When most people hear about supplements, they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that cant be obtained from foods. First, I discuss foundational supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Supplements\n(00:03:38) Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n(00:12:09) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:15:38) Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n(00:21:07) Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n(00:25:25) Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n(00:28:04) Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n(00:32:09) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:06) Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n(00:36:44) Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n(00:38:35) Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n(00:43:45) Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n(00:50:52) Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n(00:55:55) Melatonin Caution\n(00:58:11) Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n(01:03:53) Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n(01:08:59) Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root \n(01:12:48) Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions \n(01:16:04) Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork \n(01:23:06) Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido \n(01:27:24) Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n(01:30:54) Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine \n(01:36:57) Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine\n(01:38:55) Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n(01:43:58) Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(01:47:25) Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein \n(01:50:09) Kids, Aging & Supplements\n(01:55:25) A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n(01:58:36) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding the self and experiencing consciousness, not just changing ones conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (chatter) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sams recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account.

We consider how energy actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for detachment as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life.

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Creativity\n(00:04:47) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:08:51) What is Creativity?\n(00:11:16) Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher & Banksy\n(00:23:37) Neural Circuits of Creativity\n(00:27:54) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:33:13) Creative Ideas & Divergent Thinking\n(00:42:09) Testing Creative Ideas & Convergent Thinking\n(00:46:41) Dopamine, Convergent & Divergent Thinking Pathways\n(00:58:06) Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation & Divergent Thinking\n(01:07:38) Tool: Focused Attention Meditation & Convergent Thinking\n(01:11:06) Mood, Creativity & Dopamine\n(01:16:00) Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine\n(01:23:41) Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine\n(01:30:15) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine & Divergent Thinking\n(01:43:13) Serotonin, Psylocibin & Creative Thinking\n(01:49:13) Alcohol & Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis\n(01:52:04) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Creativity\n(01:54:45) Tool: Movement & Divergent Thinking\n(02:01:02) Tool: Narratives & Storytelling for Creativity\n(02:14:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nDisclaimer\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac",

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimers. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmers work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders\n(00:03:42) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:18) Nutrition & Mental Health\n(00:20:43) Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis\n(00:27:52) Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet\n(00:33:58) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:35:38) Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence\n(00:42:35) Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits\n(00:46:51) Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment\n(00:56:10) Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health\n(00:57:05) Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders\n(01:05:44) Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health\n(01:15:12) InsideTracker\n(01:16:23) Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet\n(01:25:09) Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose\n(01:31:54) Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria\n(01:40:00) Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana \n(01:46:34) Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet\n(01:55:21) Brain Imaging, Alzheimers Disease & Ketones\n(02:01:05) Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet\n(02:06:27) Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose \n(02:10:16) Alzheimers Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet\n(02:23:45) Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss\n(02:35:47) Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep\n(02:46:37) Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility\n(02:52:23) Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications \n(03:01:01) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the third-eye center, what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability.

        "summary": "I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health.

He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n(00:03:48) Sponsors: LMNT\n(00:09:16) Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n(00:15:11) The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n(00:17:51) Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n(00:22:34) Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n(00:33:02) Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n(00:35:30) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:39:00) Belief/Identity Rules, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n(00:45:49) Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n(00:48:36) Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia\n(00:54:27) Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression; Psychedelic Experience or Biology?\n(01:03:42) SSRIs, Serotonin & Depression; Childhood, Chemical Imbalance or Circuit?\n(01:13:58) Memories & Rule Creation; Psilocybin & Rule Resolution\n(01:21:00) MDMA & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment, Psilocybin & Depression Treatment\n(01:24:12) Is MDMA Neurotoxic?, Drug Purity, Dopamine Surges, Post-MDMA Prolactin\n(01:30:38) Psilocybin, Brain Connectivity & Depression Treatment\n(01:34:53) Exposure Response Prevention: Letting Go & Depression Treatment\n(01:41:23) Normal Spectrums for Mental Health Disorders\n(01:45:35) Ibogaine & Life Review; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials\n(01:57:16) Clinical Use of Psychedelics\n(02:01:59) Ayahuasca, Brazilian Prisoner Study\n(02:06:55) Cannabis: THC, CBD & Psychosis, Clinical Uses\n(02:14:52) Personal Relative Drug Risk & Alcohol\n(02:20:42) Circadian Reset for Depression, Sleep Deprivation, Light\n(02:28:43) Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study\n(02:34:25) Space Learning Theory & TMS Stimulation\n(02:45:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and ones propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)\n(00:005:02) Sponsor: LMNT\n(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety\n(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC & CBD\n(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects\n(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 & 3 Strains\n(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic & Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)\n(00:35:18) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence\n(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors & Nervous System Function\n(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis\n(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa & Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia\n(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica & Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage\n(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC & CBD, Side Effects\n(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking & Dopamine\n(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?\n(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use & Changes in Speech Patterns\n(01:46:46) Cannabis & Libido, Dopamine & Prolactin\n(01:56:55) Cannabis & Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen & Fertility\n(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis & Negative Health Consequences\n(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development\n(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety & Depression, Tolerance\n(02:25:57) Cannabis Use & Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis\n(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development & Mental Health Disorders\n(02:41:44) Cannabis & Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis\n(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n Title Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health.

Dr. Jarvis research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age.

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior  hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Effects of Alcohol Consumption\n(00:03:19) Low to Moderate Alcohol Consumption & Neurodegeneration \n(00:06:14) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:10:46) Historical Context & Uses of Alcohol \n(00:13:28) Alcohol Metabolism, Empty Calories \n(00:18:23) Inebriation: Top-Down Inhibition, Impulsivity & Memory Formation\n(00:24:23) Long-Lasting Effects & Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity & Reversibility \n(00:27:55) Food & Alcohol Absorption\n(00:30:07) Alcohol & Serotonin, SSRIs & Depression, Risk for Alcoholism, Blackouts\n(00:37:39) Predisposition for Alcoholism; Chronic Consumption, Cortisol & Stress\n(00:43:29) Sponsor: AG1\n(00:46:07) Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young\n(00:52:27) Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation & Leaky Gut \n(00:59:46) Tool: Improving/Replenishing Gut Microbiome \n(01:02:44) Reducing Alcohol Consumption & Stress \n(01:04:25) Hangover: Alcohol & Sleep, Anxiety, Headache\n(01:12:11) Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline & Deliberate Cold Exposure \n(01:17:16) Hangover Recovery, Dehydration & Electrolytes\n(01:20:45) Types of Alcohol & Hangover Severity, Congeners  \n(01:25:25) Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine & Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance   \n(01:33:36) Are There Any Positive Effects of Alcohol?, Resveratrol \n(01:35:42) Alcohol & Brain Thickness \n(01:37:11) Alcohol & Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk \n(01:44:31) Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins \n(01:46:54) Alcohol & Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n(01:50:58) Hormones: Testosterone & Estrogen Balance\n(01:55:09) Negative Effects of Alcohol Consumption \n(01:58:35) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity. I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Bipolar Disorder\n(00:03:42) Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate\n(00:9:19) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:14:24) Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder\n(00:16:30) Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania\n(00:28:58) Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability\n(00:33:07) Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States\n(00:38:20) Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability\n(00:46:53) Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder\n(00:51:51) Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts\n(00:53:06) History of Lithium Treatment\n(01:02:44) Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects\n(01:05:05) Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection\n(01:10:10) Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity\n(01:17:11) Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System\n(01:22:58) Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine\n(01:36:00) Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy\n(01:43:18) Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)\n(01:48:01) Psylocibin, Cannabis\n(01:51:50) Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n(02:03:31) Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity\n(02:06:44) Mania, Creativity & Occupations\n(02:15:33) Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment\n(02:17:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

Dr. Zuker is the worlds leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the gut-brain axis, the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception\n(00:03:22) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:35) Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception\n(00:11:48) Individual Variations within Perception, Color\n(00:16:20) Perceptions & Behaviors\n(00:20:19) The 5 Taste Modalities\n(00:26:18) Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste\n(00:28:00) Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor\n(00:30:14) Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception\n(00:34:02) Tongue Taste Map, Taste Buds & Taste Receptors \n(00:39:34) Burning Your Tongue & Perception\n(00:42:54) The Meaning of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence\n(00:51:55) Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior\n(00:56:16) Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion \n(01:01:44) Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over Ones Lifetime\n(01:09:14) Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion\n(01:17:26) Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt\n(01:24:05) Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste\n(01:28:10) Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response\n(01:36:23) Vagus Nerve\n(01:43:09) Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis\n(01:52:03) Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite\n(01:54:06) Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis \n(01:57:30) Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior\n(02:01:53) Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods \n(02:10:38) Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context\n(02:15:58) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatmentsboth behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive thought-action loops and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles.

Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and micro-stretching protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more.

I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources.

Dr. Sonnenburgs research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome\n(00:03:11) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:30) What is the Gut Microbiome?\n(00:12:49) Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability\n(00:16:00) Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets\n(00:21:56) The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford\n(00:26:30) Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations\n(00:28:58) Resilience of the Microbiome\n(00:35:10) Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract\n(00:42:04) Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health\n(00:51:19) Dietary Differences\n(01:01:24) Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods\n(01:07:03) Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners\n(01:12:44) Cleanses: Useful?

Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. \nWe discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous systemone that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Dr. David Berson \n(00:03:11) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:02) How We See \n(00:10:02) Color Vision \n(00:13:47) Strange Vision\n(00:16:56) How You Orient In Time\n(00:25:45) Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers\n(00:34:45) Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight \n(00:36:20) Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image\n(00:41:03) Sense of Balance\n(00:50:43) Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness \n(01:00:03) Popping Ears\n(01:02:35) Midbrain & Blindsight \n(01:10:44) Why Tilted Motion Feels Good \n(01:13:24) Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions\n(01:16:35) Basal Ganglia & the 2 Marshmallow Test\n(01:24:40) Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex \n(01:33:33) Neuroplasticity \n(01:36:27) What is a Connectome?\n(01:45:20) How to Learn (More About the Brain)\n(01:49:04) Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation\n(01:50:20) Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the \"threat reflex\" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma \n(00:02:31) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:06:49) What is Fear? \n(00:11:45) Autonomic Arousal: Alertness vs. Calmness\n(00:13:44) Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)\n(00:17:36) The Threat Reflex: Neural Circuits for Fear\n(00:28:24) Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing\n(00:32:27) Narratives: Protective or Dangerous\n(00:35:58) Attaching Fear to Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory\n(00:41:45) How Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA\n(00:46:10) Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears\n(00:50:25) Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies for Fear\n(00:57:56) Repetition of Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences with Good\n(01:05:28) EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing\n(01:14:00) Social Connection & Isolation Are Chemically Powerful\n(01:18:23) Trans-Generational Trauma\n(01:25:00) PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin\n(01:39:25) How Do You Know If You Are Traumatized? \n(01:46:16) Deliberate Brief Stress Can Erase Fears & Trauma\n(01:49:50) Erasing Fears & Traumas In 5 Minutes Per Day\n(01:59:42) Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma\n(02:02:30) Supplements for Anxiety, Fear: Saffron, Inositol, Kava\n(02:10:00) Synthesis \n(02:11:46) Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other peoples mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls the dark triad features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.\nThis episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introducing Dr. David Buss\n(00:04:27) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:33) Choosing a Mate\n(00:13:40) Long Term Mates: Universal Desires\n(00:18:31) What Women & Men Seek in Long-Term Mates\n(00:25:10) Age Differences & Mating History \n(00:32:20) Deception in Courtship\n(00:37:30) Emotional Stability\n(00:38:40) Lying About Long-Term Interest\n(00:41:56) Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects\n(00:46:25) Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching\n(00:54:25) Genetic Cuckolds, How Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference\n(00:57:00) Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment\n(00:59:15) Emotional & Financial Infidelity\n(01:04:35) Contraception \n(01:06:22) Status & Mating Success\n(01:10:10) Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence\n(01:24:13) Specificity of Intimate Partner Violence  \n(01:25:12) Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.\n(01:27:33) Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy\n(01:33:25) Stalking\n(01:39:15) Influence of Children on Mate Value Assessments \n(01:43:24) Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity\n(01:46:40) Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships  \n(01:54:00) Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety About the Truth\n(02:02:12) Self Deception\n(02:05:35) The Future of Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience  \n(02:06:56) Books: When Men Behave Badly; The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks\n(02:10:42) Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n(00:01:50) Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n(00:04:48) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:09:11) Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n(00:12:20) Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits \n(00:17:50) Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n(00:21:22) Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n(00:25:10) Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n(00:30:10) Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n(00:34:55) Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n(00:42:30) Theory of Mind Is Key\n(00:45:50) Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n(00:52:28) Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits \n(00:56:150 You Cant Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n(00:59:55) How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n(01:03:00) 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day \n(01:05:44) Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n(01:07:35) Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n(01:10:56) Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin \n(01:16:00) Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n(01:18:50) The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n(01:24:25) Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity.

        "summary": "In this episode, I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days.

        "summary": "This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.\nI describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the \"structural fat\" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Food & Brain Function Introduction\n(00:02:08) Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting\n(00:04:36) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:24) Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online\n(00:09:22) Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health \n(00:13:00) Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day) \n(00:20:35) Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day)\n(00:22:15) Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)\n(00:28:26) Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)\n(00:29:50) Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)\n(00:32:22) Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day) \n(00:36:28) Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries) \n(00:41:19) L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation\n(00:49:23) Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs\n(00:55:25) Taste is 100% In your Head\n(00:59:50) Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods) \n(01:06:14) Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog \n(01:07:16) Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism\n(01:12:11) Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring\n(01:13:25) Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context\n(01:18:15) Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Dont Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods)\n(01:22:17) Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences) \n(01:30:42) Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars\n(01:36:05) Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption)\n(01:38:28) Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

        "summary": "This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how \"fasted\" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction, Blood Glucose & Mortality, Mice Vs.

        "summary": "This episode I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD. Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also explains how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds.

I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional \"blinks\" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).\nThe role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed.

        "summary": "In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach, fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks\nI review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, I discuss \"cheat days,\" body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders start to finish.

We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone  how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society. \nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky \n(00:02:25) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:06:30) Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad \n(00:09:11) Valence & Amygdala \n(00:11:00) Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths \n(00:15:15) Behaviors that Affect Testosterone  \n(00:17:20) Mindsets & Contexts that Affect Testosterone\n(00:20:28) How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels  \n(00:22:30) Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female \n(00:24:05) Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis \n(00:29:20) How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation \n(00:32:32) Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY \n(00:39:40) Are Testosterone & Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping? \n(00:42:15) Stress Mitigation & Our Sense of Control \n(00:51:35) How Best to Buffer Stress \n(00:57:04) Power of Perception, Choice & Individual Differences \n(01:00:32) Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy \n(01:11:20) How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking  \n(01:13:17) Do We Have Free Will? \n(01:20:50) How to Apply Knowledge & Learning  \n(01:23:44) Roberts New Book: Determined: The Science of Life Without Free Will \n(01:28:27) Reflections, Support of Podcast, & Supporting Stress Research \nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the trutheven about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.\nThis episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean.

The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n(00:01:25) Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation \n(00:03:45) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:08:22) Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n(00:11:45) Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue \n(00:17:50) LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue  \n(00:21:00) Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n(00:29:08) Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n(00:30:54) Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n(00:34:02) Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n(00:40:50) Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n(00:42:47) Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth \n(00:48:18) Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting \n(00:51:50) Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n(00:57:00) Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients \n(00:58:58) Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n(01:02:20) Improving Nasal Microbiome \n(01:04:13) Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented \n(01:11:15) Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n(01:13:10) Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n(01:15:50) Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n(01:18:30) Probiotics & Brain Fog\n(01:21:45) Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n(01:28:25) Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n(01:30:40) Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n(01:37:00) Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n(01:38:53) Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n(01:41:50) Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n(01:45:00) Sensing Other Peoples Emotions via the Body\n(01:46:00) Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat \n(01:50:40) Conclusions & Resources\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",

I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training deliberately idle sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more.

I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives.

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more.\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said P-M-O-C but should have said POMC. Apologies.

I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. We discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels by changing their binding to other proteins, raising them directly, or changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:00:26) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT\n(00:05:50) Hormone Optimization\n(00:07:00) Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health\n(00:10:03) Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels and Ratios\n(00:15:46) The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence and Dopamine\n(00:20:58) Testosterone and Libido Pre-Ovulation\n(00:21:48) Estrogen and Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males\n(00:23:10) How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence\n(00:26:46) Testosterone and Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding\n(00:27:30) DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios\n(00:28:45) Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (and Cortisol): Parenting and Prolactin\n(00:31:24) How Illness Impacts Testosterone and Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6\n(00:33:20) How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?\n(00:34:18) Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, and Mate Recognition\n(00:43:33) Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen and Testosterone\n(00:47:44) Mouth vs. Nose Breathing and Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects\n(00:51:11) How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios\n(00:53:49) 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise\n(00:56:30) Light Viewing Patterns and Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH\n(00:57:44) Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency\n(01:04:39) Specificity of Hormone Effects\n(01:06:03) Temperature: Cold and Hot Gonads\n(01:14:10) How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing\n(01:21:42) Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)
